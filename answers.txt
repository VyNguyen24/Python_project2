Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file and your modified

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43059987061138255

Problem 3:

a) After commenting out gc_count = 0, the work occurs error that said name 'gc_count' is not defined. The reason is in order to use gc_count variable to calculate the math, we need to assign it to a value. However, turning it into a comment line will make gc_count lose its own assigned value as the coding system neglects what is in the comment line.  

b) name 'nucleotides' is not defined. Because the systen will not run or process the comment line, so commenting out this line we can not have a variable nucleotides to use for later problems. 

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.5694001293886175

Problem 5:

G count: 5738773
C count: 5898393
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547

Problem 6:

Sum of G+C+A+T counts is different from Total count and Length of nucleotides because in the data the nucleotides is not only just letter A, C, G, and T, but the data also contains other letters like N or lowercase letters which are all included in Total count and Length of nucleotides. However, Sum of G+C+A+T counts only counts for letter "A", "T","C","G", so that's why the other two will have higher quantities than the sum of these 4 nucleotides. 

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:

GC Classification: moderate GC content
